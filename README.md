# Welcome to TKMacTuning

TKMacTuning aims to help you configure Mac OS X. It is written in Java/JavaFX and is published under the terms of the GNU General Public Licence version 3. I started working on TKMacTuning in 2008, but it soon got buried under a pile of other projects.

Originally the app was planned to use Swing accompanied by the reference implementations of JSR-295 (Beans Binding) and JSR-296 (Swing Application Framework). Sigh. Those were the days... Anyway, recently I decided to do some JavaFX programming. I figured it might be a good idea to revive that project.
